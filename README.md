## Introduction
This Obsidian vault repository serves as my second brain for machine learning literature reviews. The vault contains paper notes and concept notes hyperlinked to the papers to emulate a Wiki-style graph. Over time, the vault will grow and the graph will become richer and fuller to provide a more meaningful reference experience.

I make this vault public for anyone to use if they so wish to use it as a starting point for their own, or for their own reference (if/when the vault gets big enough to be useful). This project began on 2025-01-03.

## Current Workflow
1. Find papers from various sources (e.g. Research Rabbit, newsletters, blogs, paperswithcode, etc.).
2. Add to Zotero, tag papers by topic.
3. Read first pass and annotate on Zotero. Mark papers for deeper reading.
	- Yellow: general highlight
	- Red: examine further later; turn into concept note later
	- Green: methodology
	- Blue: critical insight
4. Read the marked papers deeply on GoodNotes and create mind maps, notes, diagrams, etc.
5. Generate paper note on Obsidian (`Zotero Integration: Add Paper Note`) -- imports Zotero highlights and figures (area annotations).
6. Import GoodNotes annotations.
7. Populate the page in your own words.
8. Cite with `Zotero Integration: IEEE`
9. Create concept notes for key topics found in the paper. Hyperlink them to the paper.
10. Version control with git.

## Contribution
As this vault is my personal second brain, contributions to the vault will not generally be considered. However, please feel free to copy my workflow or even clone my vault as a starting point for your own. The concept notes may prove useful to you. 

On the other hand, if you have suggestions on how to improve my workflow or papers you think I should read, please feel free to drop an issue. Thanks!
